Loop: repeated action

	for loop: iteration is fixed

			for( init; condition; iteration){
				statements
			}

			initialization: starting point
					int i = 5;

			condition: ending point
					i < 10 ,  i >= 0

			iterator: Co-related to the condition. runs long enough to make the condition false
					i++, i++


	while loop: iteration is not fixed. repeated If

			while(condition){
				statements
			}


	do-while loop: iteration is not fixed

			do{
				statements
			}while(condition);

			at least gets executed once


Nested Loop: loop inside a loop (inner & outer)

		outer loop repeats the inner


Branching statements:
		break: exits the loop & switch
		continue: skips the current iteration of the loop
